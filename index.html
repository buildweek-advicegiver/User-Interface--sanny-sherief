          <h2>Dealing with Depression</h2>
          <span class="sub-heading">1 hour ago</span>
          <p>Depression drains your energy, hope, and drive, making it difficult to take the steps that will help you to
            feel better. Sometimes, just thinking about the things you should do to feel better, like exercising or
            spending time with friends, can seem exhausting or impossible to put into action.</p>p>
          <p>It’s the Catch-22 of depression recovery: The things that help the most are the things that are the most
            difficult to do. There is a big difference, however, between something that’s difficult and something that’s
            impossible. While recovering from depression isn’t quick or easy, you do have more control than you
            realize—even if your depression is severe and stubbornly persistent. The key is to start small and build
            from there. You may not have much energy, but by drawing on all your reserves, you should have enough to
            take a walk around the block or pick up the phone to call a loved one, for example.</p>
